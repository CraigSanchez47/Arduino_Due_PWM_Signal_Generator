# PWM Signal Generator
The goal of this project is to develop a signal generator using a microcontroller to create PWM signal via registers and give the user the ability to control the output of those signals via changing signal properties or parameters such as frequency, duty cycle, phase and dead time. For this project we are using the Arduino Due which consists of 32-bit arm processor and a clock speed fo 84MHz.
